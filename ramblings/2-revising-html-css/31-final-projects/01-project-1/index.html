            <h1>About Us</h1>
    
            <h2>Our company, our family</h2>
    
            <p>We are a local, family-run business. We began this business because we became aware of the cancer-causing
                hazard
                that radon poses. After our son was born, I learned that children are particularly
                susceptible to the negative health impacts of radon. At the time
                there was no local business that provided radon testing or mitigation. In order to keep our family safe,
                we educated ourselves. We learned how to test for radon and how to reduce radon levels. The
                first radon mitigation system we installed was in our home. I am happy that our home is now free from the
                unnecessary danger of hazardously high radon levels.</p>
    
            <p>Helping people stay safe, helping people protect their families, and helping people
                avoid cancer is what our business is all about. As we talked to friends and family about radon, we realized
                there are many people who can benefit from what we have learned. We partnered with our cousin who is a
                licensed general contractor and our business was born.</p>
    
            <p>Our goal is to help people stay healthy so that they can
                live and enjoy their lives.</p>
