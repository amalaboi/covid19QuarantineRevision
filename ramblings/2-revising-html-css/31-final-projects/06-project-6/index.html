    <p>DEFINITION of 'Massively Open Online Course (MOOC)'
    A massively online open course (MOOC) is a learning module or series of modules that are accessible over the internet at no charge. MOOCs are intended to be available to anyone who is interested in learning and do not require the learner to complete prerequisites or an entrance exam. Interested parties can simply access the course materials and work through them at their own pace. Some MOOCs gather cohorts of learners for interactive discussion, but the majority follow the reading, lecture (video or audio), and additional resource model that still makes up the backbone of most university courses.
    MOOCs can be created by anyone, but the most popular ones are created by prestigious institutions with well-known experts. For example, the Econ 252: Financial Markets MOOC produced by Yale in 2011 features Robert J. Shiller, 
    the winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Economic Science.</p>

    <p>The Future of MOOCs
    Despite the limitations, MOOCs aren�t going away. The enthusiasm for MOOCs prompted many educational institutions to take their digital future seriously. As new technologies enrich MOOCs with virtual reality and AI bot classmates that can increase learner engagement, there will be better outcomes. Moreover, universities with successful MOOCs will be encouraged to create a business model around that success. For example, it would be more attractive to potential university students if they could challenge courses that they�ve completed the MOOC for rather than having to take it all over again. Or MOOCs could have a more robust authentication and testing system where a score for a learner could become an accreditation of sorts. Time will tell, but it is possible that, far from killing universities, MOOCs open up an avenue for saving them in a world of digital education.
