<h2>Article of the Century</h2>
<p>Busta move and his fuji mixers are hell bent on taking OVER! This is not a remix, it is a promise. I was 16 when I had my first panic attack. 
I thought I was going to die. I was drenched in sweat within seconds, I had pins and needles everywhere, my chest was tight,and my left arm was tingling 
in a way that convinced me I was having a heart attack.These panic attacks would take hold of my life — I was having as many as ten a day. 
I developed an eating disorder and was unable to leave my house for months at a time.</p>

<p>My family and friends disagreed and told me that traveling would be a huge mistake. They didn’t think I was strong enough to deal with unfamiliar situations 
and were convinced I would be home within a week. In a way, their lack of faith in me spurred me on. I wanted to prove that I wasn’t as weak as they thought I was.
By the time I left, my anxiety had improved, but I was still suffering from panic attacks anywhere from once a month to several times a day. In the four years I’ve 
been on the road, though, I can count the number of attacks I’ve had on two hands. 
Despite what everyone told me, travel can actually help you overcome your anxiety.</p>
