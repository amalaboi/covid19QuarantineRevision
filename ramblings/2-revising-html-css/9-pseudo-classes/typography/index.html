  <p>Research on humor is carried out in a number of areas in psychology, including the cognitive (What makes something funny?), developmental (when do we develop a sense of humor?), and social (how is humor used in social interactions?) Although there is enough interest in the area to have spawned several societies, the literature is dispersed in a number of primary journals, with little in the way of integration of the material into a book.
  Dr. Martin is one of the best known researchers in the area, and his research goes across subdisciplines in psychology to be of wide appeal. This is a singly authored monograph that provides in one source, a summary of information researchers might wish to know about research into the psychology of humor. The material is scholarly, but the presentation of the material is suitable for people unfamiliar with the subject-making the book suitable for use for advanced undergraduate and graduate level courses on the psychology of humor-which have not had a textbook source.

    DAVID HOWARD NEVER MET MABLEY, BUT SIMPLIFIED & DUMBED-DOWN MABLEY'S THOUGHTFUL & 
    WIDE-RANGING BOOK, WHICH COVERS DRAMA FROM SOPHOCLES TO GIRAUDOUX TO WEISS' MARAT/SADE. 
    MABLEY'S BOOK IS SADLY OUT OF EDITION. THERE ARE MANY BETTER BOOKS THAN THIS - 
    TRY LINDA COWGILL, OR YVES LAVANDIER. 
    HOWARD IS THE DECEASED FRANK DANIEL'S MOST AVID DISCIPLE, BUT LACKS DANIEL'S LEARNING, 
    TALENT & INTUITION. I WORK FULL-TIME WITH PROFESSIONAL FILM WRITERS, & I'VE NEVER MET 
    ONE WHO RATED HOWARD. 
    SOMEONE SHOULD PUBLISH MABLEY'S ORIGINAL BOOK, WHICH FRANK DANIEL USED FOR TEACHING, 
    AS IT'S EMBARRASSING TO SEE HIS NAME ON HOWARD'S BOOK AS IF THEY COLLABORATED.
